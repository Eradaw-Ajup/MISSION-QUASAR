This game was made for a contest(GENESIS) on itch. This game is made by a begineer.
The game was made from scratch, in just two days(of which one day was devoted for learning godot's features).
All the assets used are from free and open sources.

Sorry for not including comments in the gd script, will do in future projects, anyways the code is easy to understand.

The game is purely meant for educational purposes.                            
THANK YOU!
